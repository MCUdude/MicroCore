/*** MicroCore - core_settings.h ***
Arduino core designed for ATtiny13
File created and maintained by MCUdude
https://github.com/MCUdude/MicroCore

This file lets you turn core functions on and off.
Since the ATtiny13 is really short on space, you
might want to disable some functions you don't
need in order to free up space.

// These defintions is used when compiling Serial printing. Serial is bitbanged, and may be tuned here

// Arduino would support.

// What should be the largest supported number?
#define PRINT_MAX_INT_TYPE PRINT_INT_TYPE_LONG // PRINT_INT_TYPE_INT, PRINT_INT_TYPE_BYTE and PRINT_INT_TYPE_LONG supported.

#define PRINT_USE_BASE_HEX
//#define PRINT_USE_BASE_OCT

// Enabling SAFEMODE takes up more flash space, but "makes sure" you don't screw up, like by reading the

// a pin as an output before using the analogWrite() function, you can save a lot of space by disabling this.

// Enabling micros() will cause the processor to interrupt more often (every 2048th clock cycle if
// F_CPU < 4.8 MHz, every 16384th clock cycle if F_CPU >= 4.8 MHz. This will add some overhead when F_CPU is
// less than 4.8 MHz. It's disabled by default because it occupies precious flash space and loads the CPU with
// additional interrupts and calculations. Also note that micros() aren't very precise for frequencies that 64
// doesn't divide evenly by.
