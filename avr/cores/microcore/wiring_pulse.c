/*** MicroCore - wiring_pulse.c ***
An Arduino core designed for ATtiny13
Based on the work done by "smeezekitty"

This file contains the pulseIn() function,
which measures the length (in microseconds)
of a pulse on the attached pin. puseIn() can
measure the HIGH duration or the LOW duration.
Works on pulses from 2-3 microseconds to 3 minutes
in length, but must be called at least a few
dozen microseconds before the start of the pulse.
