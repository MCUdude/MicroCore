/* optimized half-duplex high-speed serial uart implementation
 * @author: Ralph Doncaster 2014
 * @version: $Id$
 * soft UART has only 0.8% timing error at default 115200 baud rate @8Mhz
 * and 2.1% timing error at 230400.
 *
 * define BAUD_RATE before including HalfDuplexSerial.h to change default baud rate
 *
 * Modified by J.Sleeman (sparks@gogo.co.nz) to add Non Blocking reads
 *   RxByteNBZeroReturn   (returns BYTE 0 for no data [or null byte read])
 *   RxByteNBNegOneReturn (returns INT -1 for no data)
 * if not used these should be optimized out automatically by the linker.
 *
 * Wrapped in Stream/Print class to be able to use as Serial by J.Sleeman
 *
 * Modified by MCUdude for the MicroCore
 * https://github.com/MCUdude/MicroCore
